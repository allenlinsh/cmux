/// [#5734](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/5734)), and before this

/// reconnect and `NSWorkspace.didWakeNotification`. A live network switch
/// (Wi-Fi handoff, VPN toggle, tether) therefore left every SSH workspace
/// suspended, and the single-shot wake re-arm fires before Wi-Fi is up. This

/// `resetReconnectPolicyAndReconnect` re-arm the wake path already uses.
